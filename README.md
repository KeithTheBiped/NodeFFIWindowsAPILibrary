# NodeFFIWindowsAPILibrary
Implements node-ffi to implement common Windows API functions

This repository grew out of an Electron application running in Windows which needed to implement some simple Windows API functions to set a browser window on top.  As time goes on there will undoubtedly be more API functions that we will need to implement and they can be added to this code library for reuse by us and others.

Examples for most of the Windows API calls can be found in WinFunctions.js.  Other examples will be added as needed.
